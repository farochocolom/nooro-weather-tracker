# Nooro take home test - Weather Tracker

## Setup
- Clone the repository
- Install/open Xcode 16.2
- Run the application on a simulator or device

## Approach
I have worked with SwiftUI in the past, but never building an app from scratch with it. So I took some time to learn the ropes of setting up a SwiftUI project and how to add networking to it. That took about 1:30hr out of the 5hrs and the rest I spent bulding the project.

I got as far as setting up the search and detail view, but wasn't able to properly handle the selection of a city and didn't get to saving that data locally. The UI is about 30% done.
